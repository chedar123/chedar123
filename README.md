<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>
  Here are some selected projects that showcase both the theoretical insights and the practical programming expertise I‚Äôve gained:
</p>

<h3>Option Pricing and the Black-Scholes Equation</h3>
<p>
  As part of the <b>SF1545 - Numerical Methods</b> course, this project applied numerical integration techniques to the realm of option pricing. Initially, methods such as the trapezoidal rule and Monte Carlo integration were compared for computing integrals. Monte Carlo integration was then employed to estimate the price of a vanilla option using a specific parameter set, and the approach was similarly extended to price a rainbow option with multiple underlying assets‚Äîanalyzing how error and standard deviation evolved as the number of assets increased. Finally, the Black-Scholes equation was solved using an approximation derived from the finite difference method.

  <b>Programming language/tools used:</b> Matlab.
</p>

<h3>Prediction of Party Affiliation using Machine Learning</h3>
<p>
  For the final assignment in <b>DD1418 - Language Engineering with Introduction to Machine Learning</b>, I developed a model that predicts the political party affiliation behind speeches or statements. Utilizing data from the Swedish Riksdag, the model analyzed features such as word usage and sentence structure, and experimented with several classification methods‚Äîincluding Naive Bayes, Support Vector Classification, and Random Forest. The model was designed to handle both binary classification (differentiating between the two main Swedish political blocs, red and blue) and multiclass classification (covering nine parties).
  <br/><br/>
  <b>Programming language/tools used:</b> Python, Excel.
</p>

<h3>Travel Insurance Pricing using GLM</h3>
<p>
  In the second assignment for <b>SF2930 - Regression Analysis</b> at KTH, I focused on pricing travel insurance for a commercial customer‚Äîa task that extended beyond conventional home insurance scenarios. The project involved constructing a generalized linear model (GLM) to create risk-homogeneous groups from a sufficiently large dataset. Various groupings and variables were tested to achieve the highest possible gini-coefficient, and the final pricing was determined using the target company‚Äôs risk ratio in combination with the aggregated risk premiums.
  <br/><br/>
  <b>Programming language/tools used:</b> Python.
</p>

<h3>Classification of Song Preference using Machine Learning</h3>
<p>
  As part of the <b>SF2935 - Modern Methods of Statistical Learning</b> course at KTH, I designed a model to classify songs as either <c>good</c> or <c>bad</c> based on diverse musical features such as <c>danceability</c> and <c>energy</c>. The dataset, comprising various types of features (categorical, binary, etc.), was meticulously preprocessed to address outliers and multicollinearity. Three classification techniques‚ÄîLogistic Regression, Support Vector Classification, and Random Forest‚Äîwere mathematically outlined and applied. Given the relatively small dataset (approximately 500 rows), the model‚Äôs performance was evaluated using Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV).
  <br/><br/>
  <b>Programming language/tools used:</b> Python, Pandas, NumPy, SciKit-learn, SciPy, Seaborn.

<h3>Inventory Optimization and Demand Estimation for a Retail Company</h3>
<p>
  This project marked the culmination of my Bachelor studies in Industrial Engineering and Management at KTH. Conducted for a small Swedish retail company specializing in home appliances, the project involved forecasting future demand through time series analysis and optimizing inventory levels. By analyzing the current stock across various product categories, I developed an optimization model to identify products that were potentially redundant in terms of holding costs relative to predicted demand.
